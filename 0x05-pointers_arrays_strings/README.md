# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

This project is about the C Language.

The principal concepts learned in this project are pointers, arrays and strings.

## Tasks:

Exist two types of tasks in this project:

- Mandatory

- Advanced

### Mandatory

- 0-reset\_to_98.c &rarr; Takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

- 1-swap.c &rarr; Swaps the values of two integers.

- 2-strlen.c &rarr; Returns the length of a string.

- 3-puts.c &rarr; Prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

- 4-print_rev.c &rarr; Prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

- 5-rev_string.c &rarr; Reverses a string.

- 6-puts2.c &rarr; Prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

- 7-puts_half.c &rarr; Prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

- 8-print_array.c &rarr; Prints n elements of an array of integers.

- 9-strcpy.c &rarr; Copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

### Advanced

- 100-atoi.c &rarr; Convert a string to an integer.

- 101-keygen.c &rarr; generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.
